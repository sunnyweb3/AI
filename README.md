AI Microservices Repository

Welcome to the AI Microservices Repository! This repository is designed to offer a variety of microservices built on top of popular AI technologies, including Chat GPT, Gemini, and LAMA. The goal is to help developers and enthusiasts understand and apply these AI concepts by providing ready-made, customizable microservices that can be used for Proof of Concept (POC) purposes or extended for enterprise-grade solutions.

Overview

This repository contains several microservices utilizing state-of-the-art AI models for various use cases. Each microservice is built with flexibility and extensibility, allowing developers to integrate these services into their projects or extend them to fit specific needs.

Whether you are interested in exploring language models, generating content, or automating translation workflows, this repository serves as a resource for quickly getting started with practical AI implementations.

Technologies Covered

Chat GPT (OpenAI): A language model used for natural language understanding and generation.

Gemini (Google DeepMind): For advanced language tasks and content generation.

LAMA: A language model for text analysis and filling masked language.

The repository aims to present these technologies in the form of microservices, demonstrating different AI capabilities and making them accessible for practical use.

Microservices Included

Book Translation Microservice: Translates LaTeX documents from Spanish to English while retaining formatting. Built using Python, Flask, and OpenAI's GPT models.

More Coming Soon: The repository will be continually updated with new AI-based microservices to demonstrate the practical application of emerging AI tools.

Getting Started

Each microservice is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. To get started, you can either clone this repository, build the Docker image, or download pre-built images from Docker Hub. Below are the general steps for launching a microservice:

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd AI-Microservices

Build Docker Image:

docker build -t <microservice_name>:<version> .

Run the Microservice:

docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env <microservice_name>:<version>

Use Cases

These microservices are ideal for:

Quick Proof of Concept (POC) development for AI projects.

Testing various AI models and their performance in practical applications.

Exploring and experimenting with natural language processing and content generation.

Learning about microservice architecture and containerized deployment.
